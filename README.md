Implementation of the paper based game "K채sek채stchen"

The German game [K채sek채stchen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4sek%C3%A4stchen) is a paper and pencil game everybody loved to play in school back in the day, whenever the subject was boring. It is similar, I am told, to [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes).

This is a just for fun project to bring back old memories to current technology :-).
